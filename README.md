Markov character ngrams 4. source texts a description of large language models and The Book of Genesis.

First:

A table of next characters is made by

taking the  source texts  and looking at every four characters and making a table of the next letters that follow those four characters.

``` javascript

{code :  [' ', 'd', '.', ',', ' ', 'd', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r']}
 
```


Second we pick a random starting point

and generated the text by looking at each four characters and adding one of the possibilities from the table.
