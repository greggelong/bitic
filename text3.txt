In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 
And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. 
And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. 
And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. 
And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. 
And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. 
And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. 
And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. 
And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. 
And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good. 
And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. 
And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. 
And the evening and the morning were the third day. 
And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: 
And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. 
And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. 
And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 
And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. 
And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. 
And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. 
And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good. 
And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. 
And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. 
And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. 
And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good. 
And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 
So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. 
And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. 
And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. 
And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all their multitude.
And on the seventh day God finished the work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all the work that he had done.
So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all the work that he had done in creation.
These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created. In the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,
 when no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up - for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no one to till the ground;
 but a stream would rise from the earth, and water the whole face of the ground -
then the LORD God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being.
And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
Out of the ground the LORD God made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
 A river flows out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it divides and becomes four branches.
The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one that flows around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
and the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.
The name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one that flows around the whole land of Cush.
The name of the third river is Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till it and keep it.
 And the LORD God commanded the man, "You may freely eat of every tree of the garden;
[but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die."
Then the LORD God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper as his partner."
So out of the ground the LORD God formed every animal of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.
The man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every animal of the field; but for the man there was not found a helper as his partner.
[So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; then he took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.
 And the rib that the LORD God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.
Then the man said, "This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; this one shall be called Woman, for out of Man this one was taken."
 Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife, and they become one flesh.
 And the man and his wife were both naked, and were not ashamed.


Now the serpent was more crafty than any other wild animal that the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God say, 'You shall not eat from any tree in the garden'?"
 The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden;
but God said, 'You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden, nor shall you touch it, or you shall die. '"
 But the serpent said to the woman, "You will not die;
for God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."
 So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate; and she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate.
 Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves.
They heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden at the time of the evening breeze, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.
 But the LORD God called to the man, and said to him, "Where are you?"
He said, "I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself."
 He said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?"
The man said, "The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate."
Then the LORD God said to the woman, "What is this that you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent tricked me, and I ate."
The LORD God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed are you among all animals and among all wild creatures; upon your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.
I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will strike your head, and you will strike his heel."
 To the woman he said, "I will greatly increase your pangs in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children, yet your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you."
And to the man he said, "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree about which I commanded you, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground because of you; in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life;
thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the field.
By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; you are dust, and to dust you shall return."
The man named his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all living.
And the LORD God made garments of skins for the man and for his wife, and clothed them.
 Then the LORD God said, "See, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil; and now, he might reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever"--
therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.
He drove out the man; and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim, and a sword flaming and turning to guard the way to the tree of life.



A large language model (LLM) is a computerized language model, embodied by an artificial neural network using an enormous amount of "parameters" ("neurons" in its layers with up to tens of millions to billions "weights" between them), that are (pre-)trained on many GPUs in relatively short time due to massive parallel processing of vast amounts of unlabeled texts containing up to trillions of tokens (parts of words) provided by corpora such as Wikipedia Corpus and Common Crawl, using self-supervised learning or semi-supervised learning,[1] resulting in a tokenized vocabulary with a probability distribution. LLMs can be upgraded by using additional GPUs to (pre-)train the model with even more parameters on even vaster amounts of unlabeled texts.[2]

The invention of algorithm known as transformer, either unidirectional (such as used by GPT models) or bidirectional (such as used by BERT model), allows for such massively parallel processing.[3] Due to all above, most of the older (specialized) supervised models for specific tasks became outdated.[4]

In an implicit way, LLMs have acquired an embodied knowledge about syntax, semantics and "ontology" inherent in human language corpora, but also inaccuracies and biases present in the corpora.[4]

History
Precursors
The basic idea of LLMs, which is to start with a neural network as black box with randomized weights, using a simple repetitive architecture and (pre-)training it on a large language corpus, was not feasible until the 2010s when use of GPUs had enabled massively parallelized processing, which has gradually replaced the logical AI approach that has relied on symbolic programs.[5][6][7]

Precursors of LLMs included the Elman network,[8] in which a recurrent network was trained on simple sentences like "dog chases man". Then, the (pre-)trained model was used to convert each word into a vector (its 'internal representation'). These vectors were clustered by closeness into a tree. The tree was then found to have a structure. The verbs and nouns each belonged to one large cluster. Within the noun cluster, there are two clusters: inanimates and animates. And so on.

In the 1950s, without the modern GPUs enabling massively parallel processing, the idea to learn natural language by a simple repetitive architecture remained just an idea.[9][10] Later in 1990s, the IBM alignment models[11] for statistical machine translation announced the future success of LLMs.[12] An early work that uses corpus scraped from the Internet for word disambiguation (such as distinguishing "then" and "than") in 2001. It used a 1-billion-word corpus, considered huge at the time.[13]

Lead-up to the transformer framework
The earliest "large" language models were built with recurrent architectures such as the long short-term memory (LSTM) (1997). After AlexNet (2012) demonstrated the effectiveness of large neural networks for image recognition, researchers applied large neural networks to other tasks. In 2014, two main techniques were proposed.

The seq2seq model (380 million parameters) used two LSTMs to perform machine translation,[14] and the same approach was used in[15] (130 million parameters) but with a simplified architecture (GRU).
The attention mechanism was proposed in 2014 paper by Bahdanau et. al.,[16] where a seq2seq model was improved by adding an "attention mechanism" in the middle between the two LSTMs. This is "additive attention", which is not the same attention mechanism (scaled "dot product attention") as in Transformer, but it accomplishes a similar task.[17]
In 2016, Google Translate changed its technology from statistical machine translation to neural machine translation. It was a seq2seq with LSTM and attention. It took them 9 months to reach a higher level of performance than the previous system built over 10 years.[18][19]

The 2017 paper "Attention is all you need"[17] abstracted out the attention mechanism from 2014 paper by Bahdanau et. al.,[16] and constructed the Transformer architecture around the attention mechanism. Whereas the seq2seq model have to process an input sequence one at a time like all recurrent networks, the Transformer architecture can be run in parallel over the sequence. This allows much larger models to be trained and used.

BERT and GPT
While there are many models with different names, most have underlying architectures being one of two types: BERT (2018)[20] is a bidirectional Transformer, while GPTs (2018+)[21][22] are unidirectional ("autoregressive") Transformers. These are the main architectures as of 2023.

Origin of the term and disambiguation
While the term of Large Language Models has itself emerged around 2018, it gained visibility in 2019 and 2020, with the release of DistilBERT[23] and Stochastic Parrots[24] papers respectively. Both focused on the "Large-scale pretrained models", citing as an example of LLMs the BERT family, starting at 110M parameters and referring to models in the 340M parameters range as "very large LMs".

Perhaps surprisingly, both cite the pre-transformer RNN-based ELMo - the 2018 architecture that inspired BERT - as the first LLM, given the number of parameters (94M), as well as the size of the pretraining dataset (>1B tokens)[25]. Despite the comparable parameter size, the original Transformer is generally not considered as an LLM due to a smaller pretraining dataset (generally estimated in the 100M tokens range).

Overall, due to a smooth scaling in LLM model performance from ~100M parameters to 500B+ parameters and progressive unlocking of emergent capabilities such as multi-lingual translation, arithmetic, or programming code composition, all post-ELMo models are referred to by researchers as LLMs.[26][27][28][29]

Linguistic foundations
Cognitive Linguistics offers a scientific first principle direction for quantifying states-of-mind through natural language processing[30] to enable a computer to "understand" the contents of text and documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them. The developmental trajectory of NLP, known as cognitive NLP sets the groundwork as a unitary language model for emulating intelligent behavior and apparent comprehension of natural language. The specialized form of the model considers a block of text, sentence, phrase or word as a token to create a vector database based on tokens presented before and after the token being analyzed. In it's generalized form a token can be replaced by any contextually relevant symbol like a group of pixels, mathematical symbols, coding constructs, molecular formulae etc for non-textual applications.[31]

Architecture

Transformer model architecture
Large language models have most commonly used the transformer architecture, which, since 2018, has become the standard deep learning technique for sequential data.[4] An alternative line of architecture is the mixture of experts (MoE), which is often used in AI models developed by Google, starting with sparsely-gated MoE (2017),[32] and proceeding to Gshard (2021)[33] and GLaM (2022).[34]

Tokenization
LLMs are mathematical functions whose input and output are lists of numbers. Consequently, words must be converted to numbers.

In general, a LLM uses a separate tokenizer. A tokenizer maps between texts and lists of integers. The tokenizer is generally adapted to the entire training dataset first, then frozen, before the LLM is trained. A common choice is byte pair encoding.

Another function of tokenizers is text compression, which saves compute. Common words or phrases like "where is" can be encoded into one token, instead of 7 characters. The OpenAI GPT series uses a tokenizer where 1 token maps to around 4 characters, or around 0.75 words, in common English text.[35] Uncommon English text is less predictable, thus less compressible, thus requiring more tokens to encode.

Tokenizer cannot output arbitrary integers. They generally output only integers in the range 


Some tokenizers are capable of handling arbitrary text (generally by operating directly on Unicode), but some do not. When encountering un-encodable text, a tokenizer would output a special token (often 0) that represents "unknown text". This is often written as [UNK], such as in the BERT paper.

Another special token commonly used is [PAD] (often 1), for "padding". This is used because LLMs are generally used on batches of text at one time, and these texts do not encode to the same length. Since LLMs generally require input to be an array that is not jagged, the shorter encoded texts must be padded until they match the length of the longest one.

Output
The output of a LLM is a probability distribution over its vocabulary. This is usually implemented as follows:

Upon receiving a text, the bulk of the LLM outputs a vector 
 that is, it is a probability distribution over the LLM's vocabulary.

Note that the softmax function is defined mathematically with no parameters to vary. Consequently it is not trained.

Context window
The context window of a LLM is the length of the longest sequence of tokens that a LLM can use to generate a token. If a LLM is to generate a token over a sequence longer than the context window, it would have to either truncate the sequence down to the context window, or use certain algorithmic modifications.

The context window of LLM tend to be on the order of 1,000 (1k) to 10k. In particular, OpenAI offers GPT-3.5 with context window from 4k to 16k as of June 2023.[36]

Terminology of encoders and decoders
In LLM based on Transformers, the terminology is somewhat different than the terminology used in the original Transformer paper:[37]

"encoder only": full encoder, full decoder.
"encoder-decoder": full encoder, autoregressive decoder.
"decoder only": autoregressive encoder, autoregressive decoder.
Here "autoregressive" means that a mask is inserted in the attention head to zero out all attention from one token to all tokens following it, as described in the "masked attention" section.
 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 
And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
